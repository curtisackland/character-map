# Character Map

This is a redesign of Microsoft Windows' Character Map.

## Running the application

Place the ```character_data.json``` file under the ```src``` directory.

Install Node.js version 18.12.1 from https://nodejs.org/en/download

Install npm version 8.19.2 (a similar version should come with Node.js)

Then run:
```
npm install
```

```
npm run serve
```

This should host the app on your machine and give you a localhost address to access the application with.
